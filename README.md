# Conformal prediction tutorials

The aim of these tutorials is to showcase how to use conformal prediction methods in R to construct prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification and to understand a bit of the theory behind them.

The data (in csv format) for the examples can be found in the **data** folder. 

The following tutorials are available:
- [x] Conformal prediction intervals with the **problably** package (Regression)
- [x] Conformal prediction for time series forecasting
